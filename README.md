# Consumer-Finances

Segmentation, PCA, Web App

The data is downloaded from "https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/scfindex.htm" . It is the survey of consumer finances. It has 351 columns. 
The notebook explores some variables for people who are credit fearful. Then it segments all consumers based of 5 variables which have highest variances
using **KMeans Clustering Algorithm**.

To visualise the segments, two **Principal Components** are used. 
A **webapp** is also created to present the findings.

Here are some snippets:
